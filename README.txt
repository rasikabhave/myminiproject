Title of project: Game of chess
This is an attempt to write an application that allows two users to play a game of chess.
The user needs to click on the piece he wants to move and then where it wants the piece to be placed.
The user is given options like undo, new game, and quit game using keys from the keyboard.
The white pieces are player 1(P1) while the black player is portrayed as player 2(P2).
The usual rules of chess are followed, and the players do get warnings whenever the king is in check.
The Ncurses library is used to develop the graphical user interface.
